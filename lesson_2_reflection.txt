What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new, hidden, directory called .git is created in the working directory. That is the repository. It will host metadata recording the history of changes of the files being tracked. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is not a directory, but rather it seems to me like a virtual area where you can filter the files and get them ready for a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By placing a modified file in the staging area, we allow for comparison between the modified version and the latest version of the document. This way we can clearly see what the changes are, and thus make sure they make up a coherent and cohesive logical unit. Otherwise there would be no way of comparing the new version of the document with the latest commit to the git repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
